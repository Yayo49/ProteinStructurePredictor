# ProteinStructurePredictor

This is some JavaScript I wrote for a school project.  It is aa toy protein secondary structure predictor.  It is missing the training data because Github only allows uploads 25 MB or less.  The dataset can be found using this link.  A Kallge account is required.  https://www.kaggle.com/alfrandom/protein-secondary-structure/home
