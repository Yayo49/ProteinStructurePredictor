# ProteinStructurePredictor

This is some JavaScript I wrote for a school project.  It is a toy protein secondary structure predictor.  It is missing the training data because Github only allows uploads 25 MB or less.  The dataset can be found using this link.  A Kaggle account is required.  https://www.kaggle.com/alfrandom/protein-secondary-structure/home

Tu train the neural net, just run index.js in the same directory as neuralNetworkLibrary.js and the dataset file 2018-06-06-ss.cleaned.csv
